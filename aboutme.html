<p> About Me: Hi my name is Edie Arteaga, I am a senior at Burlingame High School in California. I am a curious and ambitious leader because I enjoy learning computer science and find the fusion of technology with everyday life to be paramount. As I move forward in my soon knowledge of Java, HTML, and Python, I will work to bind these languages into everyday fundamentals. .<p>
